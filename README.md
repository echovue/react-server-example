react-server-example
--------------------

Cloned from https://github.com/mhart/react-server-example

Additional code was added to support Rollbar server-side error reporting.

You'll need a server-side access token from http://rollbar.com

Update the key in the place indicated inside server.js

`var rollbar = new Rollbar("*** Replace Rollbar Server-Side Access Token ***");`
